# Algorithm in C++

This repository contains common algorithms written in C++14.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the programs, you need to have g++ and cmake install in your local machine, you can use the following instructions to compile the program.

```
cmake .
make
```

## Running the tests
